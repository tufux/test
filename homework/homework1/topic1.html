        <H2>JavaScript</H2>
        <h4>JavaScript is a programming language amongst the three main technologies that build up web pages, 
        HTML and CSS being the two others. The programming language differs greatly from its name brother JAVA,
        tho both have simmular syntax, name and both languages being object orientated.<br>
        It is used primarely to make websites interactive and allow for online programs, such as music player,
        video games and others.<br>
        JavaScripts is most often run on the clients computer, making it open for editing in web browsers 
        (for example in developer mode in Chrome), making it unwise to use in login systems by it self.
        <br><br>It is worth mentioning that JavaScript is now also implemented in some server-side software and non-web based program such as runtime envirement for JavaScript.
